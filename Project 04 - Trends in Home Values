/* We can see by the data that from 1997 to 2007 there was an increase in the home values for all the states, in some states there was even more explict as fot the homes in DC where their value increased in more than 300%.
On the other hand, that tendency is not true for the years 2007 to 2017, which we can see an deacrease in the home value approximatly 50% of the states, having it`s higher decrease for the DE state.
